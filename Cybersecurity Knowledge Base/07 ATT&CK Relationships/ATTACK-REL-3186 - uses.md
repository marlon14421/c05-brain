## Meaning for defensive analysis

Connects a behavior, group, campaign, or software object to something it uses. This is a catalog relationship, not proof of current activity.

## Source description

[Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) has used Base64-encoded data to transfer payloads and commands, including deobfuscation via [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160).(Citation: Secureworks BRONZE SILHOUETTE May 2023)

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records. Preserve its direction and relationship label, cite the source object identifiers, and avoid upgrading a catalog association into an incident claim. For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

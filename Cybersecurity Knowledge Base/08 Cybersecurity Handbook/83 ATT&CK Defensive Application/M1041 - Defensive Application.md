# M1041: Encrypt Sensitive Information — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/M1041 - Encrypt Sensitive Information|M1041 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Mitigation
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

Protect sensitive information at rest, in transit, and during processing by using strong encryption algorithms. Encryption ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, preventing unauthorized access or tampering. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Encrypt Data at Rest: - Use Case: Use full-disk encryption or file-level encryption to secure sensitive data stored on devices. - Implementation: Implement BitLocker for Windows systems or FileVault for macOS devices to encrypt hard drives. Encrypt Data in Transit: - Use Case: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS, HTTPS) to encrypt sensitive data as it travels over networks. - Implementation: Enable HTTPS for all web applications and configure mail servers to enforce STARTTLS for email encryption. Encrypt Backups: - Use Case: Ensure that backup data is encrypted both during storage and transfer to prevent unauthorized access. - Implementation: Encrypt cloud backups using AES-256 before uploading them to Amazon S3 or Google Cloud. Encrypt Application Secrets: - Use Case: Store sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration files in encrypted vaults. - Implementation: Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage and encrypt secrets. Database Encryption: - Use Case: Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) or column-level encryption in database management systems. - Implementation: Use MySQL’s built-in encryption features to encrypt sensitive database fields such as social security numbers.

## Defensive focus

Assess the control as an implementable safeguard with a defined owner, target population, configuration, exception path, and evidence of operation.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets and versions support this control, and where are exceptions required?
- Does the control reduce the relevant exposure without disabling a legitimate business function?
- How is coverage measured and configuration drift detected?
- What compensating control applies where the primary safeguard is unavailable?
- What test demonstrates continued effectiveness after updates?

## Safe validation

Pilot configuration changes in a representative test group, obtain owner approval, and preserve a tested rollback plan. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# DC0104: Response Content — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/DC0104 - Response Content|DC0104 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Data Component
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

Captured network traffic that provides details about responses received during an internet scan. This data includes both protocol header values (e.g., HTTP status codes, IP headers, or DNS response codes) and response body content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or raw data). Examples: - HTTP Scan: A web server responds to a probe with an HTTP 200 status code and an HTML body indicating the default page is accessible. - DNS Scan: A DNS server replies to a query with a resolved IP address for a domain, along with details like Time-To-Live (TTL) and authoritative information. - TCP Banner Grab: A service listening on a port (e.g., SSH or FTP) responds with a banner containing service name, version, or other metadata.

## Defensive focus

Evaluate whether this telemetry component supplies timely and trustworthy evidence for a stated defensive question while respecting privacy and retention limits.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which platform and event sources generate the data, and are they enabled throughout the target population?
- Are timestamps, identities, and fields reliable enough for the intended analytic?
- What collection gaps, sampling, or parser changes could weaken conclusions?
- Which sensitive fields need minimization or access restrictions?
- How are retention, integrity, and responder access governed?

## Safe validation

Validate collection with benign, expected events on owned systems and synthetic accounts. Document missing sources and do not infer absence of behavior from absent telemetry. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

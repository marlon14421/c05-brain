# DC0059: File Metadata — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/DC0059 - File Metadata|DC0059 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Data Component
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

contextual information about a file, including attributes such as the file's name, size, type, content (e.g., signatures, headers, media), user/owner, permissions, timestamps, and other related properties. File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: - File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM on Windows. - Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file. - File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation. - File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows. - File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds. - File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.

## Defensive focus

Evaluate whether this telemetry component supplies timely and trustworthy evidence for a stated defensive question while respecting privacy and retention limits.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which platform and event sources generate the data, and are they enabled throughout the target population?
- Are timestamps, identities, and fields reliable enough for the intended analytic?
- What collection gaps, sampling, or parser changes could weaken conclusions?
- Which sensitive fields need minimization or access restrictions?
- How are retention, integrity, and responder access governed?

## Safe validation

Validate collection with benign, expected events on owned systems and synthetic accounts. Document missing sources and do not infer absence of behavior from absent telemetry. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# T1201: Password Policy Discovery — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/T1201 - Password Policy Discovery|T1201 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Technique
- Platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, IaaS, Network Devices, Identity Provider, SaaS, Office Suite
- Tactics: discovery

## Source context

Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment. Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts). Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as net accounts (/domain) , Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy , chage -l , cat /etc/pam.d/common-password , and pwpolicy getaccountpolicies (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies). Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to discover password policy information (e.g. show aaa , show aaa common-criteria policy all ).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A) Password policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as GetAccountPasswordPolicy in AWS (Citation: AWS GetPasswordPolicy).

## Defensive focus

Map the recorded behavior or objective to assets, trust boundaries, identities, and defensive controls in the local environment. ATT&CK classification alone does not establish activity or compromise.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets, roles, platforms, and business services are actually exposed to this behavior?
- What prevention or hardening control applies, and which owner maintains it?
- Which telemetry source can support or refute the behavior, and what blind spots remain?
- What legitimate administrative or software behavior could look similar?
- What containment or recovery decision is authorized if evidence is confirmed?

## Safe validation

Use an isolated lab, benign simulation, or sanitized historical data. Test only owned or explicitly authorized systems; do not reproduce harmful behavior against production targets. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# T1136: Create Account — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/T1136 - Create Account|T1136 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Technique
- Platforms: Windows, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Network Devices, Containers, SaaS, Office Suite, Identity Provider, ESXi
- Tactics: persistence

## Source context

Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems.(Citation: Symantec WastedLocker June 2020) With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system. Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant. In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection.

## Defensive focus

Map the recorded behavior or objective to assets, trust boundaries, identities, and defensive controls in the local environment. ATT&CK classification alone does not establish activity or compromise.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets, roles, platforms, and business services are actually exposed to this behavior?
- What prevention or hardening control applies, and which owner maintains it?
- Which telemetry source can support or refute the behavior, and what blind spots remain?
- What legitimate administrative or software behavior could look similar?
- What containment or recovery decision is authorized if evidence is confirmed?

## Safe validation

Use an isolated lab, benign simulation, or sanitized historical data. Test only owned or explicitly authorized systems; do not reproduce harmful behavior against production targets. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# T1690: Prevent Command History Logging — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/T1690 - Prevent Command History Logging|T1690 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Technique
- Platforms: ESXi, Linux, macOS, Network Devices, Windows
- Tactics: defense-impairment

## Source context

Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they have done. On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable `HISTFILE`. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called `~/.bash_history`. The `HISTCONTROL` environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the `~/.bash_history` file when a user logs out. `HISTCONTROL` does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected. The `HISTFILE` environment variable is also used in some ESXi systems.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence ESXi VIBs 2022) Adversaries may clear the history environment variable (`unset HISTFILE`) or set the command history size to zero (`export HISTFILESIZE=0`) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally, `HISTCONTROL` can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to "ignorespace". `HISTCONTROL` can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that " ls" will not be saved, but "ls" would be saved by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands. On Windows systems, the `PSReadLine` module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file (`$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt` by default). Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using `Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}`. This will cause `ConsoleHost_history.txt` to stop receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command `Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing`.(Citation: Microsoft about_History prevent command history)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History Forensics) Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to disable historical command logging (e.g. `no logging`).

## Defensive focus

Map the recorded behavior or objective to assets, trust boundaries, identities, and defensive controls in the local environment. ATT&CK classification alone does not establish activity or compromise.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets, roles, platforms, and business services are actually exposed to this behavior?
- What prevention or hardening control applies, and which owner maintains it?
- Which telemetry source can support or refute the behavior, and what blind spots remain?
- What legitimate administrative or software behavior could look similar?
- What containment or recovery decision is authorized if evidence is confirmed?

## Safe validation

Use an isolated lab, benign simulation, or sanitized historical data. Test only owned or explicitly authorized systems; do not reproduce harmful behavior against production targets. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

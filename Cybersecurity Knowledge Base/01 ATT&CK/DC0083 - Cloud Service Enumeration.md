## Source description

Cloud service enumeration involves listing or querying available cloud services in a cloud control plane. This activity is often performed to identify resources such as virtual machines, storage buckets, compute clusters, or other services within a cloud environment. Examples include API calls like `AWS ECS ListServices`, `Azure ListAllResources`, or `Google Cloud ListInstances`. Examples: AWS Cloud Service Enumeration: The adversary gathers details about existing ECS services to identify opportunities for privilege escalation or exfiltration. - Azure Resource Enumeration: The adversary collects information about virtual machines, resource groups, and other Azure assets for reconnaissance purposes. - Google Cloud Resource Enumeration: The attacker seeks to map the environment and find misconfigured or underutilized resources for exploitation. - Office 365 Service Enumeration: The attacker may look for data repositories or collaboration tools to exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

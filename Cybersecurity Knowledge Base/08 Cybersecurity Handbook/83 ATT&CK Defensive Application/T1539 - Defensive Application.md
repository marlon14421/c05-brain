# T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie|T1539 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Technique
- Platforms: Linux, macOS, Office Suite, SaaS, Windows
- Tactics: credential-access

## Source context

An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website. Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.(Citation: Pass The Cookie) There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.(Citation: Kaspersky TajMahal April 2019)(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019) Adversaries may also steal cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript content into websites or relying on [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) by tricking victims into running malicious JavaScript in their browser.(Citation: Talos Roblox Scam 2023)(Citation: Krebs Discord Bookmarks 2023) There are also open source frameworks such as `Evilginx2` and `Muraena` that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy (e.g., [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)) that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.(Citation: Github evilginx2)(Citation: GitHub Mauraena) After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004) technique to login to the corresponding web application.

## Defensive focus

Map the recorded behavior or objective to assets, trust boundaries, identities, and defensive controls in the local environment. ATT&CK classification alone does not establish activity or compromise.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets, roles, platforms, and business services are actually exposed to this behavior?
- What prevention or hardening control applies, and which owner maintains it?
- Which telemetry source can support or refute the behavior, and what blind spots remain?
- What legitimate administrative or software behavior could look similar?
- What containment or recovery decision is authorized if evidence is confirmed?

## Safe validation

Use an isolated lab, benign simulation, or sanitized historical data. Test only owned or explicitly authorized systems; do not reproduce harmful behavior against production targets. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# DC0075: Instance Enumeration — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/DC0075 - Instance Enumeration|DC0075 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Data Component
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

The process of retrieving or querying a list of virtual machine instances or compute instances within a cloud infrastructure. This activity provides a view of all available or running instances, typically including their associated metadata such as instance ID, name, state, and configuration details. Examples: - AWS: instance enumeration involves the `DescribeInstances` API call, which retrieves information about running or stopped EC2 instances. - Azure: VM enumeration can be monitored via the `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read` operation. - GCP: instance enumeration is logged as an `instance.list` operation within GCP Audit Logs. *Data Collection Measures:* - AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail logs stored in S3 or forwarded to CloudWatch. - Azure Activity Logs: Accessible via Azure Monitor or exported to a storage account. - GCP Audit Logs: Logs Explorer or BigQuery.

## Defensive focus

Evaluate whether this telemetry component supplies timely and trustworthy evidence for a stated defensive question while respecting privacy and retention limits.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which platform and event sources generate the data, and are they enabled throughout the target population?
- Are timestamps, identities, and fields reliable enough for the intended analytic?
- What collection gaps, sampling, or parser changes could weaken conclusions?
- Which sensitive fields need minimization or access restrictions?
- How are retention, integrity, and responder access governed?

## Safe validation

Validate collection with benign, expected events on owned systems and synthetic accounts. Document missing sources and do not infer absence of behavior from absent telemetry. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

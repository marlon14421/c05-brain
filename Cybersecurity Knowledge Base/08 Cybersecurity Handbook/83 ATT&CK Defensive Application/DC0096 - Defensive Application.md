# DC0096: Passive DNS — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/DC0096 - Passive DNS|DC0096 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Data Component
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

"Domain Name: Passive DNS" captures logged historical and real-time domain name system (DNS) data. This includes records of domain-to-IP address resolutions over time, enabling analysts to track the evolution of domain infrastructure, uncover historical patterns of use, and detect malicious activities tied to domains and their associated IP addresses. Examples: - Historical Resolutions - Shared IP Usage - Temporal Patterns - Malicious Domain Clustering - Historical Lookback This data component can be collected through the following measures: - Passive DNS Platforms: Use platforms that specialize in passive DNS collection and analysis: - Tools: Farsight DNSDB, RiskIQ PassiveTotal, PassiveDNS. - Threat Intelligence Feeds: Integrate passive DNS data from commercial or open-source threat intelligence providers. - Custom DNS Collectors: Deploy custom tools to capture DNS traffic at the network level for analysis. - Cloud DNS Services: Leverage cloud DNS services (e.g., AWS Route 53, Azure DNS) that maintain DNS query logs.

## Defensive focus

Evaluate whether this telemetry component supplies timely and trustworthy evidence for a stated defensive question while respecting privacy and retention limits.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which platform and event sources generate the data, and are they enabled throughout the target population?
- Are timestamps, identities, and fields reliable enough for the intended analytic?
- What collection gaps, sampling, or parser changes could weaken conclusions?
- Which sensitive fields need minimization or access restrictions?
- How are retention, integrity, and responder access governed?

## Safe validation

Validate collection with benign, expected events on owned systems and synthetic accounts. Document missing sources and do not infer absence of behavior from absent telemetry. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

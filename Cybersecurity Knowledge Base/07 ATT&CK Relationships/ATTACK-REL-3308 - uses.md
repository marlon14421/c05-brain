## Meaning for defensive analysis

Connects a behavior, group, campaign, or software object to something it uses. This is a catalog relationship, not proof of current activity.

## Source description

During [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014), threat actors used their own web shells, as well as those previously placed on target systems by other threat actors, for reconnaissance and lateral movement.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records. Preserve its direction and relationship label, cite the source object identifiers, and avoid upgrading a catalog association into an incident claim. For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

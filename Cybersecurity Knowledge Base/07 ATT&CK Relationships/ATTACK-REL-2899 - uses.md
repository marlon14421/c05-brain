## Meaning for defensive analysis

Connects a behavior, group, campaign, or software object to something it uses. This is a catalog relationship, not proof of current activity.

## Source description

[Ramsay](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0458) can detect system information--including disk names, total space, and remaining space--to create a hardware profile GUID which acts as a system identifier for operators.(Citation: Eset Ramsay May 2020)(Citation: Antiy CERT Ramsay April 2020)

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records. Preserve its direction and relationship label, cite the source object identifiers, and avoid upgrading a catalog association into an incident claim. For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

# T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

> **Defensive knowledge record.** Use this entry to support detection, prevention, incident response, and security education. Descriptions summarize the source; validate decisions against current systems and threat context.

**Class:** Technique  
**ATT&CK ID:** T1547  
**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Network Devices  
**Tactics:** persistence, privilege-escalation

## Source description

Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key)(Citation: MSDN Authentication Packages)(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)(Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013)(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel. Since some boot or logon autostart programs run with higher privileges, an adversary may leverage these to elevate privileges.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

# T1216: System Script Proxy Execution

> **Defensive knowledge record.** Use this entry to support detection, prevention, incident response, and security education. Descriptions summarize the source; validate decisions against current systems and threat context.

**Class:** Technique  
**ATT&CK ID:** T1216  
**Platforms:** Windows  
**Tactics:** stealth

## Source description

Adversaries may use trusted scripts, often signed with certificates, to proxy the execution of malicious files. Several Microsoft signed scripts that have been downloaded from Microsoft or are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files.(Citation: LOLBAS Project) This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application control and signature validation on systems.(Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

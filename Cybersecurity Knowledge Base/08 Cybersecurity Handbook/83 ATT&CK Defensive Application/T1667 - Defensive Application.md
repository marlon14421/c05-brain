# T1667: Email Bombing — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/T1667 - Email Bombing|T1667 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Technique
- Platforms: Linux, Office Suite, Windows, macOS
- Tactics: impact

## Source context

Adversaries may flood targeted email addresses with an overwhelming volume of messages. This may bury legitimate emails in a flood of spam and disrupt business operations.(Citation: sophos-bombing)(Citation: krebs-email-bombing) An adversary may accomplish email bombing by leveraging an automated bot to register a targeted address for e-mail lists that do not validate new signups, such as online newsletters. The result can be a wave of thousands of e-mails that effectively overloads the victim’s inbox.(Citation: krebs-email-bombing)(Citation: hhs-email-bombing) By sending hundreds or thousands of e-mails in quick succession, adversaries may successfully divert attention away from and bury legitimate messages including security alerts, daily business processes like help desk tickets and client correspondence, or ongoing scams.(Citation: hhs-email-bombing) This behavior can also be used as a tool of harassment.(Citation: krebs-email-bombing) This behavior may be a precursor for [Spearphishing Voice](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/004). For example, an adversary may email bomb a target and then follow up with a phone call to fraudulently offer assistance. This social engineering may lead to the use of [Remote Access Software](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1663) to steal credentials, deploy ransomware, conduct [Financial Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657)(Citation: sophos-bombing), or engage in other malicious activity.(Citation: rapid7-email-bombing)

## Defensive focus

Map the recorded behavior or objective to assets, trust boundaries, identities, and defensive controls in the local environment. ATT&CK classification alone does not establish activity or compromise.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets, roles, platforms, and business services are actually exposed to this behavior?
- What prevention or hardening control applies, and which owner maintains it?
- Which telemetry source can support or refute the behavior, and what blind spots remain?
- What legitimate administrative or software behavior could look similar?
- What containment or recovery decision is authorized if evidence is confirmed?

## Safe validation

Use an isolated lab, benign simulation, or sanitized historical data. Test only owned or explicitly authorized systems; do not reproduce harmful behavior against production targets. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

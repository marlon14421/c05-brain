## Source description

Contextual information about an Internet-facing resource collected during a scan, including details such as open ports, running services, protocols, and versions. This metadata is typically derived from interpreting scan results and helps build a profile of the targeted system. Examples: - Port and Service Details: - Open ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443). - Identified services running on those ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS). - Service Versions: Detected software version information (e.g., Apache 2.4.41, OpenSSH 8.2). - Operating System Information: OS fingerprinting data (e.g., Linux Kernel 5.4.0). - TLS/SSL Certificate Data: Information about the TLS/SSL certificate, such as the expiration date, issuer, and cipher suites. *Data Collection Measures:* - Scanning Tools: - Nmap: Collects port, service, and version information using commands like nmap -sV . - Masscan: High-speed scanning tool for discovering open ports and active services. - Zmap: Focused on large-scale Internet scanning, collecting metadata about discovered services. - Shodan API: Retrieves scan metadata for publicly exposed devices and services. - Network Logs: - Use logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to gather metadata from scan attempts. Example: Zeek or Suricata logs for incoming scan traffic. - OSINT Platforms: Platforms like Censys, GreyNoise, or Shodan provide aggregated metadata about Internet-facing resources. - Cloud Metadata Services: AWS Security Hub, Azure Monitor, or GCP Security Command Center can collect and centralize scan-related metadata for Internet-facing resources in cloud environments.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

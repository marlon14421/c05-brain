## Source description

Object access refers to activities where AD objects (e.g., user accounts, groups, policies) are accessed or queried. Example: Windows Event ID 4661 logs object access attempts. Examples: - Attribute Access: e.g., `userPassword`, `memberOf`, `securityDescriptor`. - Group Enumeration: Enumerating critical group members (e.g., Domain Admins). - User Attributes: Commonly accessed attributes like `samAccountName`, `lastLogonTimestamp`. - Policy Access: Accessing GPOs to understand security settings. *Data Collection Measures:* - Audit Policies: - Enable "Audit Directory Service Access" under Advanced Audit Policies (Success and Failure). - Path: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > Object AccessEnable: Audit Directory Service Access` (Success and Failure). - Captured Events: IDs 4661, 4662. - Event Forwarding: Use WEF to centralize logs for SIEM analysis. - SIEM Integration: Collect and parse logs (e.g., 4661, 4662) using tools like Splunk or Azure Sentinel. - Log Filtering: - Focus on sensitive objects/attributes like: - `Domain Admins` group. - `userPassword`, `ntSecurityDescriptor`. - Enable EDR Monitoring: - Detect processes accessing sensitive AD objects (e.g., samAccountName, securityDescriptor). - Log all attempts to enumerate critical groups (e.g., "Domain Admins").

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Source description

Cloud Storage Modification involves tracking changes made to cloud storage infrastructure, including updates to settings, permissions, or stored data. Examples include modifying object access control lists (ACLs), uploading new objects, or updating bucket policies. Examples: AWS S3: An object is uploaded or its ACL is modified. - Azure Blob Storage: A blob's metadata or permissions are updated. - Google Cloud Storage: An object's lifecycle policy is updated, or a bucket policy is changed. - OpenStack Swift: Modifications to container settings or uploading of new objects.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

# CWE-20: Improper Input Validation — Defensive Review

## Source record

- Catalog entry: [[02 Weaknesses CWE/CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation|CWE-20 source record]]
- Abstraction: Class
- Catalog status: Stable
- Applicable platforms: Not Language-Specific, AI/ML

## Weakness description

The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.

## Defensive review questions

- Identify the affected component, trust boundary, data or operation, and accountable owner.
- Determine whether the described condition exists in the current implementation or configuration; a CWE classification alone is not proof.
- Trace relevant inputs, states, permissions, and downstream effects to establish reachability and realistic impact.
- Review whether existing validation, authorization, isolation, monitoring, and recovery controls change the risk.
- Check adjacent code paths and supported versions for the same underlying cause.

## Catalog mitigations

- **Architecture and Design:** Consider using language-theoretic security (LangSec) techniques that characterize inputs using a formal language and build "recognizers" for that language. This effectively requires parsing to be a distinct layer that effectively enforces a boundary between raw input and internal data representations, instead of allowing parser code to be scattered throughout the program, where it could be subject to errors or inconsistencies that create weaknesses. [REF-1109] [REF-1110] [REF-1111]
- **Architecture and Design:** Use an input validation framework such as Struts or the OWASP ESAPI Validation API. Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).
- **Architecture and Design:** Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter the product, including but not limited to: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.
- **Implementation:** When your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but violate the intended restrictions after they have been combined.
- **Implementation:** Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger an overflow.
- **Implementation:** Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the input's values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies are maintained.
- **Implementation:** When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.

Treat catalog guidance as a starting point. Confirm that each mitigation applies to the actual platform and version, does not introduce a new weakness, and addresses the root cause rather than only suppressing a symptom.

## Safe validation plan

Review source code, configuration, build settings, and test evidence first. If behavior testing is needed, use an owned local or staging system, synthetic data, dedicated test identities, and a non-destructive test case. Define the scope and stop condition in advance. Do not test third-party or production systems without explicit written authorization, and do not collect real credentials or personal data.

For regression coverage, express the security property as an expected allow/deny, validation, isolation, or failure behavior. Include a legitimate-use case and a negative case. Record environment, version, method, expected result, actual result, and remaining uncertainty.

## Remediation and verification

Assign an owner and select a fix based on the affected implementation, platform guidance, and the source mitigation above. Verify the corrected behavior at the relevant boundary, review comparable paths, and run regression tests for legitimate workflows. Track residual risk and exception expiry if remediation is incomplete.

## Provenance

This review companion interprets the linked MITRE CWE record for defensive learning. It does not assert that a particular product is vulnerable, that the weakness is exploitable, or that a security incident has occurred. Confirm catalog version and licensing against the original source before redistribution or training use.

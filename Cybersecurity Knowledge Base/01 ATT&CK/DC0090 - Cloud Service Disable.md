# DC0090: Cloud Service Disable

## Source description

This data component refers to monitoring actions that deactivate or stop a cloud service in a cloud control plane. Examples include disabling essential logging services like AWS CloudTrail (`StopLogging` API call), Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs, or Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver). Disabling such services can hinder visibility into adversary activities within the cloud environment. Examples: - AWS CloudTrail StopLogging: This action stops logging of API activity for a particular trail, effectively reducing the monitoring and visibility of AWS resources and activities. - Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs: Disabling these logs hinders the organization’s ability to detect anomalous activities and trace malicious actions. - Google Cloud Logging: Disabling cloud logging removes visibility into resource activity, preventing monitoring of service access or configuration changes. - SaaS Applications: Stopping logging removes visibility into user activities, such as email access or file downloads, enabling undetected malicious behavior.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

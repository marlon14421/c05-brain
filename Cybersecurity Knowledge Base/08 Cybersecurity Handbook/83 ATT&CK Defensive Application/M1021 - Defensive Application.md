## Source context

Restricting web-based content involves enforcing policies and technologies that limit access to potentially malicious websites, unsafe downloads, and unauthorized browser behaviors. This can include URL filtering, download restrictions, script blocking, and extension control to protect against exploitation, phishing, and malware delivery. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Deploy Web Proxy Filtering: - Use solutions to filter web traffic based on categories, reputation, and content types. - Enforce policies that block unsafe websites or file types at the gateway level. Enable DNS-Based Filtering: - Implement tools to restrict access to domains associated with malware or phishing campaigns. - Use public DNS filtering services to enhance protection. Enforce Content Security Policies (CSP): - Configure CSP headers on internal and external web applications to restrict script execution, iframe embedding, and cross-origin requests. Control Browser Features: - Disable unapproved browser features like automatic downloads, developer tools, or unsafe scripting. - Enforce policies through tools like Group Policy Management to control browser settings. Monitor and Alert on Web-Based Threats: - Use SIEM tools to collect and analyze web proxy logs for signs of anomalous or malicious activity. - Configure alerts for access attempts to blocked domains or repeated file download failures.

## Defensive focus

Assess the control as an implementable safeguard with a defined owner, target population, configuration, exception path, and evidence of operation.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets and versions support this control, and where are exceptions required?
- Does the control reduce the relevant exposure without disabling a legitimate business function?
- How is coverage measured and configuration drift detected?
- What compensating control applies where the primary safeguard is unavailable?
- What test demonstrates continued effectiveness after updates?

## Safe validation

Pilot configuration changes in a representative test group, obtain owner approval, and preserve a tested rollback plan. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

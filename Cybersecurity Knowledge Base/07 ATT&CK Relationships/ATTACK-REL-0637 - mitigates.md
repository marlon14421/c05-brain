Use secure out-of-band authentication methods to verify the authenticity of critical actions initiated via email, such as password resets, financial transactions, or access requests. For highly sensitive information, utilize out-of-band communication channels instead of relying solely on email to prevent adversaries from collecting data through compromised email accounts.(Citation: TrustedSec OOB Communications)

## Source description

[ShimRatReporter](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0445) is a tool used by suspected Chinese adversary [Mofang](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0103) to automatically conduct initial discovery. The details from this discovery are used to customize follow-on payloads (such as [ShimRat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0444)) as well as set up faux infrastructure which mimics the adversary's targets. [ShimRatReporter](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0445) has been used in campaigns targeting multiple countries and sectors including government, military, critical infrastructure, automobile, and weapons development.(Citation: FOX-IT May 2016 Mofang)

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Meaning for defensive analysis

Connects a behavior, group, campaign, or software object to something it uses. This is a catalog relationship, not proof of current activity.

## Source description

[APT33](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064) has deployed a tool known as [DarkComet](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0334) to the Startup folder of a victim, and used Registry run keys to gain persistence.(Citation: Symantec Elfin Mar 2019)(Citation: Microsoft Holmium June 2020)

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records. Preserve its direction and relationship label, cite the source object identifiers, and avoid upgrading a catalog association into an incident claim. For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

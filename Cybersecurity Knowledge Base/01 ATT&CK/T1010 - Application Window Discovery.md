# T1010: Application Window Discovery

> **Defensive knowledge record.** Use this entry to support detection, prevention, incident response, and security education. Descriptions summarize the source; validate decisions against current systems and threat context.

**Class:** Technique  
**ATT&CK ID:** T1010  
**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows  
**Tactics:** discovery

## Source description

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. Window listings could convey information about how the system is used.(Citation: Prevailion DarkWatchman 2021) For example, information about application windows could be used identify potential data to collect as well as identifying security tooling ([Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001)) to evade.(Citation: ESET Grandoreiro April 2020) Adversaries typically abuse system features for this type of enumeration. For example, they may gather information through native system features such as [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) commands and [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

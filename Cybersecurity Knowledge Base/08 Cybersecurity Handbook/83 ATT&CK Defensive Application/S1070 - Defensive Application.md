# S1070: Black Basta — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/S1070 - Black Basta|S1070 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Malware
- Platforms: Windows, ESXi
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

[Black Basta](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1070) is ransomware written in C++ that has been offered within the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model since at least April 2022; there are variants that target Windows and VMWare ESXi servers. [Black Basta](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1070) operations have included the double extortion technique where in addition to demanding ransom for decrypting the files of targeted organizations the cyber actors also threaten to post sensitive information to a leak site if the ransom is not paid. [Black Basta](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1070) affiliates have targeted multiple high-value organizations, with the largest number of victims based in the U.S. Based on similarities in TTPs, leak sites, payment sites, and negotiation tactics, security researchers assess the [Black Basta](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1070) RaaS operators could include current or former members of the [Conti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575) group.(Citation: Palo Alto Networks Black Basta August 2022)(Citation: Deep Instinct Black Basta August 2022)(Citation: Minerva Labs Black Basta May 2022)(Citation: Avertium Black Basta June 2022)(Citation: NCC Group Black Basta June 2022)(Citation: Cyble Black Basta May 2022)

## Defensive focus

Use the record as contextual threat intelligence, not as attribution evidence or proof that a specific organization is targeted. Prioritize observable behaviors and relevant defensive exposure.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which source claims are independently supported, current, and relevant to this environment?
- Which behavior, platform, or dependency can be translated into a control or detection hypothesis?
- Are names, indicators, and reported relationships time-bounded and subject to reuse or reclassification?
- What local evidence would confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis?
- Which response steps protect evidence and avoid premature attribution?

## Safe validation

Use public reporting and sanitized lab data. Do not acquire or execute malware or tools from a catalog entry; use approved analysis procedures and isolated environments when necessary. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

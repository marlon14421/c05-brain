# C0057: 3CX Supply Chain Attack — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/C0057 - 3CX Supply Chain Attack|C0057 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Campaign
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

The [3CX Supply Chain Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0057) was the first publicly reported case of one supply chain compromise triggering another, leading to a cascading, two-stage intrusion. The initial supply chain attack began when a 3CX employee downloaded and executed a trojanized, end-of-life version of the X_Trader trading software from Trading Technologies. This provided UNC4736, a threat cluster associated with [AppleJeus](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1049), access to the 3CX environment. From there UNC4736 compromised the Windows and macOS build environments used to distribute the 3CX desktop application to their customers.(Citation: Mandiant 3cx UNC4736 2023) While 3CX serves more than 600,000 customers and 12 million users, only a subset of systems were affected. Subsequent targeting focused on victims in the defense and cryptocurrency sectors, where attackers deployed secondary payloads such as Gopuram for credential theft and persistence.(Citation: Kaspersky 3CX Gopuram 2023) The campaign began in late 2022 and was disrupted after security vendors publicly reported the compromise in March 2023.(Citation: 3cx official statement 2023)(Citation: Krebs 3cx overview 2023)

## Defensive focus

Use the record as contextual threat intelligence, not as attribution evidence or proof that a specific organization is targeted. Prioritize observable behaviors and relevant defensive exposure.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which source claims are independently supported, current, and relevant to this environment?
- Which behavior, platform, or dependency can be translated into a control or detection hypothesis?
- Are names, indicators, and reported relationships time-bounded and subject to reuse or reclassification?
- What local evidence would confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis?
- Which response steps protect evidence and avoid premature attribution?

## Safe validation

Use public reporting and sanitized lab data. Do not acquire or execute malware or tools from a catalog entry; use approved analysis procedures and isolated environments when necessary. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

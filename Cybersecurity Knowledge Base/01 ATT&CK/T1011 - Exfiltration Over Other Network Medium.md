# T1011: Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium

> **Defensive knowledge record.** Use this entry to support detection, prevention, incident response, and security education. Descriptions summarize the source; validate decisions against current systems and threat context.

**Class:** Technique  
**ATT&CK ID:** T1011  
**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows  
**Tactics:** exfiltration

## Source description

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, the exfiltration may occur, for example, over a WiFi connection, modem, cellular data connection, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel. Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access or proximity, and the connection might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

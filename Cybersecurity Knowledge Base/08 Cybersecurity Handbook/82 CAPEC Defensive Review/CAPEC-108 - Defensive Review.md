# CAPEC-108: Command Line Execution through SQL Injection — Defensive Review

## Source record

- Catalog entry: [[03 Attack Patterns CAPEC/CAPEC-108 - Command Line Execution through SQL Injection|CAPEC-108 source record]]
- Abstraction: Detailed
- Catalog severity: Very High
- Catalog likelihood: Low

## Pattern summary

An attacker uses standard SQL injection methods to inject data into the command line for execution. This could be done directly through misuse of directives such as MSSQL_xp_cmdshell or indirectly through injection of data into the database that would be interpreted as shell commands. Sometime later, an unscrupulous backend application (or could be part of the functionality of the same application) fetches the injected data stored in the database and uses this data as command line arguments without performing proper validation. The malicious data escapes that data plane by spawning new commands to be executed on the host.

## Defensive interpretation

This catalog entry describes an attack pattern for threat modeling and defensive analysis. Map the conditions to assets, entry points, and controls in your own environment. Prioritize prevention, safe validation, logging, and incident response; this summary is not an execution guide and does not prove an active threat.

A catalog severity or likelihood rating describes the catalog pattern, not the risk of a specific system. Confirm relevance against asset exposure, implementation, controls, and current evidence.

## Threat modeling questions

- Which asset, user, data, or business process could be affected?
- What preconditions, trust boundaries, identities, or external dependencies are relevant?
- Which preventive control should stop the pattern, and where is it enforced?
- What benign activity could resemble the same signal?
- What evidence can validate the control without affecting real users or data?

## Safe validation

Use a local lab, synthetic data, and dedicated test identities. Begin with design and configuration review; if behavior testing is needed, define written authorization, scope, rate limits, time window, stop conditions, and an owner for recovery. Do not test third-party or production systems without explicit authorization. Avoid retrieving real sensitive data or causing service disruption.

## Defensive control and detection plan

Map the pattern to a specific control owner, expected behavior, telemetry source, alert or review condition, and response action. Test detection with benign simulations or historical sanitized data. Document coverage gaps and false-positive cases. Choose mitigation from current platform guidance and verify the legitimate workflow still functions after the change.

## Finding record

If evidence confirms a weakness, record affected component and version, preconditions, observed behavior, impact, confidence, mitigation, owner, and a measurable retest criterion. Distinguish observed facts from hypotheses; the CAPEC entry alone is not evidence of compromise.

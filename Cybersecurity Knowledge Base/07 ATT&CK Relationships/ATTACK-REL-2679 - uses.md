## Meaning for defensive analysis

Connects a behavior, group, campaign, or software object to something it uses. This is a catalog relationship, not proof of current activity.

## Source description

[APT28](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007) uses a tool to infect connected USB devices and transmit itself to air-gapped computers when the infected USB device is inserted.(Citation: Microsoft SIR Vol 19)

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records. Preserve its direction and relationship label, cite the source object identifiers, and avoid upgrading a catalog association into an incident claim. For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

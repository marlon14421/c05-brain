# M1060: Out-of-Band Communications Channel — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/M1060 - Out-of-Band Communications Channel|M1060 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Mitigation
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

Establish secure out-of-band communication channels to ensure the continuity of critical communications during security incidents, data integrity attacks, or in-network communication failures. Out-of-band communication refers to using an alternative, separate communication path that is not dependent on the potentially compromised primary network infrastructure. This method can include secure messaging apps, encrypted phone lines, satellite communications, or dedicated emergency communication systems. Leveraging these alternative channels reduces the risk of adversaries intercepting, disrupting, or tampering with sensitive communications and helps coordinate an effective incident response.(Citation: TrustedSec OOB Communications)(Citation: NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5)

## Defensive focus

Assess the control as an implementable safeguard with a defined owner, target population, configuration, exception path, and evidence of operation.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets and versions support this control, and where are exceptions required?
- Does the control reduce the relevant exposure without disabling a legitimate business function?
- How is coverage measured and configuration drift detected?
- What compensating control applies where the primary safeguard is unavailable?
- What test demonstrates continued effectiveness after updates?

## Safe validation

Pilot configuration changes in a representative test group, obtain owner approval, and preserve a tested rollback plan. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

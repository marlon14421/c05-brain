## Source description

[Covenant](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1155) is a multi-platform command and control framework written in .NET. While designed for penetration testing and security research, the tool has also been used by threat actors such as [HAFNIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0125) during operations. [Covenant](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1155) functions through a central listener managing multiple deployed "Grunts" that communicate back to the controller.(Citation: Github Covenant)(Citation: Microsoft HAFNIUM March 2020)

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

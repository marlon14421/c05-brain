Connects a behavior, group, campaign, or software object to something it uses. This is a catalog relationship, not proof of current activity.

## Source description

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records.

For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

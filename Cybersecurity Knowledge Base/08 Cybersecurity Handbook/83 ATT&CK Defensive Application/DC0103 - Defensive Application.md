# DC0103: Active DNS — Defensive Application

## Source context

"Domain Name: Active DNS" data component captures queried DNS registry data that highlights current domain-to-IP address resolutions. This data includes both direct queries to DNS servers and records that provide mappings between domain names and associated IP addresses. It serves as a critical resource for tracking active infrastructure and understanding the network footprint of an organization or adversary. Examples: - DNS Query Example: `nslookup example.com`, `dig example.com A` - PTR Record Example: `dig -x 192.168.1.1` - Tracking Malicious Domains: DNS logs reveal repeated queries to suspicious domains like malicious-site.com. The IPs resolved by these domains may be indicators of compromise (IOCs). - DNS Record Types - A/AAAA Record: Maps domain names to IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6). - CNAME Record: Canonical name records, often used for redirects. - MX Record: Mail exchange records, used to route emails. - TXT Record: Can include security information like SPF or DKIM policies. - SOA Record: Start of authority record for domain management. - NS Record: Lists authoritative name servers for the domain. This data component can be collected through the following measures: - System Utilities: Use built-in tools like `nslookup`, `dig`, or host on Linux, macOS, and Windows to perform active DNS queries. - DNS Logging - Windows DNS Server: Enable DNS Analytical Logging to capture DNS queries and responses. - Bind DNS: Enable query logging in the named.conf file. - Cloud Provider DNS Logging - AWS Route 53: Enable query logging through CloudWatch or S3: - Google Cloud DNS: Enable logging for Cloud DNS queries through Google Cloud Logging. - Network Traffic Monitoring: Use tools like Wireshark or Zeek to analyze DNS queries within network traffic. - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Integration: Aggregate DNS logs in a SIEM like Splunk to create alerts and monitor patterns. - Public OSINT Tools: Use OSINT platforms like VirusTotal, or PassiveTotal to collect information on domains and their associated IP addresses.

## Defensive focus

Evaluate whether this telemetry component supplies timely and trustworthy evidence for a stated defensive question while respecting privacy and retention limits.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which platform and event sources generate the data, and are they enabled throughout the target population?
- Are timestamps, identities, and fields reliable enough for the intended analytic?
- What collection gaps, sampling, or parser changes could weaken conclusions?
- Which sensitive fields need minimization or access restrictions?
- How are retention, integrity, and responder access governed?

## Safe validation

Validate collection with benign, expected events on owned systems and synthetic accounts. Document missing sources and do not infer absence of behavior from absent telemetry. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# DC0083: Cloud Service Enumeration — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/DC0083 - Cloud Service Enumeration|DC0083 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Data Component
- Platforms: Not specified
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

Cloud service enumeration involves listing or querying available cloud services in a cloud control plane. This activity is often performed to identify resources such as virtual machines, storage buckets, compute clusters, or other services within a cloud environment. Examples include API calls like `AWS ECS ListServices`, `Azure ListAllResources`, or `Google Cloud ListInstances`. Examples: AWS Cloud Service Enumeration: The adversary gathers details about existing ECS services to identify opportunities for privilege escalation or exfiltration. - Azure Resource Enumeration: The adversary collects information about virtual machines, resource groups, and other Azure assets for reconnaissance purposes. - Google Cloud Resource Enumeration: The attacker seeks to map the environment and find misconfigured or underutilized resources for exploitation. - Office 365 Service Enumeration: The attacker may look for data repositories or collaboration tools to exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Defensive focus

Evaluate whether this telemetry component supplies timely and trustworthy evidence for a stated defensive question while respecting privacy and retention limits.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which platform and event sources generate the data, and are they enabled throughout the target population?
- Are timestamps, identities, and fields reliable enough for the intended analytic?
- What collection gaps, sampling, or parser changes could weaken conclusions?
- Which sensitive fields need minimization or access restrictions?
- How are retention, integrity, and responder access governed?

## Safe validation

Validate collection with benign, expected events on owned systems and synthetic accounts. Document missing sources and do not infer absence of behavior from absent telemetry. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

# AN1630: Analytic 1630 — Defensive Application

## Source record

- [[01 ATT&CK/AN1630 - Analytic 1630|AN1630 source record]]
- ATT&CK class: Detection Analytic
- Platforms: Network Devices
- Tactics: Not specified

## Source context

Defenders may observe adversary attempts to extract configuration data from management repositories by monitoring for anomalous SNMP queries, API calls, or protocol requests (e.g., NETCONF, RESTCONF) that enumerate system configuration. Suspicious sequences include repeated queries from untrusted IPs, abnormal query types requesting sensitive configuration data, or repository access occurring outside of normal administrative maintenance windows. Abnormal authentication attempts, sudden enumeration of device inventory, or bulk data transfer of configuration files may also be observed.

## Defensive focus

Treat the analytic as a hypothesis about observable behavior. Validate data availability, field meaning, time coverage, and environment-specific benign patterns before enabling response automation.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Are required event sources enabled, retained, and correctly parsed for the relevant asset population?
- Does the analytic distinguish the behavior from common administrative and software activity?
- What benign test or sanitized dataset can validate the expected signal?
- What response action is proportionate, reversible, and approved?
- How will missed coverage, false positives, and rule changes be measured?

## Safe validation

Test against synthetic events or sanitized, authorized data. Do not trigger suspicious behavior on third-party or production systems simply to produce an alert. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

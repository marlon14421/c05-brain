## Meaning for defensive analysis

Links a defensive mitigation to the behavior it is intended to reduce. Check implementation details and local constraints before applying it.

## Source description

Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware or unusual data transfer over known tools and protocols like FTP can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions.

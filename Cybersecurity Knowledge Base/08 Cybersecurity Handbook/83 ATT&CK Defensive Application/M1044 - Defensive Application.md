# M1044: Restrict Library Loading — Defensive Application

## Source context

Restricting library loading involves implementing security controls to ensure that only trusted and verified libraries (DLLs, shared objects, etc.) are loaded into processes. Adversaries often abuse Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) Injection, DLL Search Order Hijacking, or LD_PRELOAD mechanisms to execute malicious code by forcing the operating system to load untrusted libraries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Enforce Safe Library Loading Practices: - Enable `SafeDLLSearchMode` on Windows. - Restrict `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` usage on Linux systems. Code Signing Enforcement: - Require digital signatures for all libraries loaded into processes. - Use tools like Signtool, and WDAC to enforce signed DLL execution. Environment Hardening: - Secure library paths and directories to prevent adversaries from placing rogue libraries. - Monitor user-writable directories and system configurations for unauthorized changes. Audit and Monitor Library Loading: - Enable `Sysmon` on Windows to monitor for suspicious library loads. - Use `auditd` on Linux to monitor shared library paths and configuration file changes. Use Application Control Solutions: - Implement AppLocker, WDAC, or SELinux to allow only trusted libraries. *Tools for Implementation* Windows-Specific Tools: - AppLocker: Application whitelisting for DLLs. - Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC): Restrict unauthorized library execution. - Signtool: Verify and enforce code signing. - Sysmon: Monitor DLL load events (Event ID 7). Linux-Specific Tools: - auditd: Monitor changes to library paths and critical files. - SELinux/AppArmor: Define policies to restrict library loading. - ldconfig and chattr: Secure LD configuration files and prevent unauthorized modifications. Cross-Platform Solutions: - Wazuh or OSSEC: File integrity monitoring for library changes. - Tripwire: Detect and alert on unauthorized library modifications.

## Defensive focus

Assess the control as an implementable safeguard with a defined owner, target population, configuration, exception path, and evidence of operation.

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.

## Review checklist

- Which assets and versions support this control, and where are exceptions required?
- Does the control reduce the relevant exposure without disabling a legitimate business function?
- How is coverage measured and configuration drift detected?
- What compensating control applies where the primary safeguard is unavailable?
- What test demonstrates continued effectiveness after updates?

## Safe validation

Pilot configuration changes in a representative test group, obtain owner approval, and preserve a tested rollback plan. Define written scope, test window, accounts, data boundaries, and stop conditions in advance. Preserve only the evidence required to verify the control and protect it from unauthorized access.

## Evidence and response

Record the source and version, environment, time range, expected behavior, observations, alternative explanations, and telemetry gaps. A catalog mapping is a lead for analysis, not an incident finding. Escalate and contain only under approved response procedures; verify remediation with a measurable retest.

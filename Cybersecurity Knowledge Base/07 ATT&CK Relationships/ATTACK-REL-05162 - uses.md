## Defensive meaning

Records a catalog association between the source object and something it uses. This is not evidence that the behavior is active in a particular environment.

## Source description

[KV Botnet Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0035) utilizes multiple Bash scripts during botnet installation stages, and the final botnet payload allows for running commands in the Bash shell.(Citation: Lumen KVBotnet 2023)

## AI use

Retrieve this edge with both endpoint records. Preserve direction and type, cite the identifiers, and distinguish catalog information from observed events. Verify recommendations against current environment evidence and authoritative product guidance.

## Source description

[RustyWater](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S9037) has an obfuscated function (i.e. love_me__()) that dynamically reconstructs the string WScript.Shell using hard-coded ASCII values and the Chr() function.(Citation: CloudSEK_RustyWater_Jan2026)

## AI use

Retrieve this edge with both endpoint records. Preserve direction and type, cite the identifiers, and distinguish catalog information from observed events. Verify recommendations against current environment evidence and authoritative product guidance.

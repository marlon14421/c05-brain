## Defensive meaning

Records a catalog association between the source object and something it uses. This is not evidence that the behavior is active in a particular environment.

## Source description

During [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014), the threat actors executed `/c cd /d c:\windows\temp\ & reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ \PuTTY\Sessions\` to detect recent PuTTY sessions, likely to further lateral movement.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)

## AI use

Retrieve this edge with both endpoint records. Preserve direction and type, cite the identifiers, and distinguish catalog information from observed events. Verify recommendations against current environment evidence and authoritative product guidance.

# Relationship 1439: M1031 — mitigates → T1568

**Source object:** [[01 ATT&CK/M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention|M1031: Network Intrusion Prevention]]  
**Relationship:** `mitigates`  
**Target object:** [[01 ATT&CK/T1568 - Dynamic Resolution|T1568: Dynamic Resolution]]

## Meaning for defensive analysis

Links a defensive mitigation to the behavior it is intended to reduce. Check implementation details and local constraints before applying it.

## Source description

Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Malware researchers can reverse engineer malware variants that use dynamic resolution and determine future C2 infrastructure that the malware will attempt to contact, but this is a time and resource intensive effort.(Citation: Cybereason Dissecting DGAs)(Citation: Cisco Umbrella DGA Brute Force)

## How an AI should use this fact

Retrieve this edge together with both linked records. Preserve its direction and relationship label, cite the source object identifiers, and avoid upgrading a catalog association into an incident claim. For operational recommendations, inspect the linked records and corroborate against current telemetry and authoritative product guidance.

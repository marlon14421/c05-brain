# Relationship 5037: S0038 — uses → T1053.005

**Source object:** [[01 ATT&CK/S0038 - Duqu|S0038: Duqu]]  
**Relationship:** `uses`  
**Target object:** [[01 ATT&CK/T1053.005 - Scheduled Task|T1053.005: Scheduled Task]]

## Defensive meaning

Records a catalog association between the source object and something it uses. This is not evidence that the behavior is active in a particular environment.

## Source description

Adversaries can instruct [Duqu](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0038) to spread laterally by copying itself to shares it has enumerated and for which it has obtained legitimate credentials (via keylogging or other means). The remote host is then infected by using the compromised credentials to schedule a task on remote machines that executes the malware.(Citation: Symantec W32.Duqu)

## AI use

Retrieve this edge with both endpoint records. Preserve direction and type, cite the identifiers, and distinguish catalog information from observed events. Verify recommendations against current environment evidence and authoritative product guidance.

# CAPEC-138: Reflection Injection — Defensive Review

## Source record

- Catalog entry: [[03 Attack Patterns CAPEC/CAPEC-138 - Reflection Injection|CAPEC-138 source record]]
- Abstraction: Standard
- Catalog severity: Very High
- Catalog likelihood: Not stated

## Pattern summary

An adversary supplies a value to the target application which is then used by reflection methods to identify a class, method, or field. For example, in the Java programming language the reflection libraries permit an application to inspect, load, and invoke classes and their components by name. If an adversary can control the input into these methods including the name of the class/method/field or the parameters passed to methods, they can cause the targeted application to invoke incorrect methods, read random fields, or even to load and utilize malicious classes that the adversary created. This can lead to the application revealing sensitive information, returning incorrect results, or even having the adversary take control of the targeted application.

## Defensive interpretation

This catalog entry describes an attack pattern for threat modeling and defensive analysis. Map the conditions to assets, entry points, and controls in your own environment. Prioritize prevention, safe validation, logging, and incident response; this summary is not an execution guide and does not prove an active threat.

A catalog severity or likelihood rating describes the catalog pattern, not the risk of a specific system. Confirm relevance against asset exposure, implementation, controls, and current evidence.

## Threat modeling questions

- Which asset, user, data, or business process could be affected?
- What preconditions, trust boundaries, identities, or external dependencies are relevant?
- Which preventive control should stop the pattern, and where is it enforced?
- What benign activity could resemble the same signal?
- What evidence can validate the control without affecting real users or data?

## Safe validation

Use a local lab, synthetic data, and dedicated test identities. Begin with design and configuration review; if behavior testing is needed, define written authorization, scope, rate limits, time window, stop conditions, and an owner for recovery. Do not test third-party or production systems without explicit authorization. Avoid retrieving real sensitive data or causing service disruption.

## Defensive control and detection plan

Map the pattern to a specific control owner, expected behavior, telemetry source, alert or review condition, and response action. Test detection with benign simulations or historical sanitized data. Document coverage gaps and false-positive cases. Choose mitigation from current platform guidance and verify the legitimate workflow still functions after the change.

## Finding record

If evidence confirms a weakness, record affected component and version, preconditions, observed behavior, impact, confidence, mitigation, owner, and a measurable retest criterion. Distinguish observed facts from hypotheses; the CAPEC entry alone is not evidence of compromise.

## Source description

Object deletion in AD (e.g., user accounts, groups, OUs) is logged as Event ID 5141. Examples: - User Account: Deleted user. - Group: Deleted security/distribution group. - Organizational Unit (OU): Loss of configurations or policies. - Service Account: Disrupted operations or cover tracks. - Trust Object: Removed domain trust, disrupting connectivity. *Data Collection Measures:* - Audit Policy: - Enable "Audit Directory Service Changes" (Success and Failure). - Path: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > Directory Service Changes`. - Key Event: Event ID 5141. - Log Forwarding: Use WEF to centralize logs for SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk). - Enable EDR Monitoring: - Detect processes or users that initiate unauthorized object deletions. - Monitor tools and scripts that may delete key directory objects.

## Defensive use

Use this record as a prompt for threat modeling and defensive review. Identify relevant assets and trust boundaries, determine whether the behavior is applicable to the environment, then consult detection and mitigation references before acting. A technique or tool listing alone is not evidence that an incident occurred.
